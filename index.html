      <p>After high school Donny just didn't know what he wanted to do with his life. So like many people Donny held off on picking a career and just started working your every day normal job. After only working two different jobs in ten years he realized that he didn't dislike the work, but it wasn't satisfying. So one day his big brother suggested he look into programming. Donny took his advice and started researching how to create web sites from scratch. After submerging himself in html and css for a few weeks he seen the potential of a fulfilling career. Less then a month later he was going to college to get a degree in Web Development. After graduating Donny realized there was still much to learn and that the real journey had begun. So he has kept educating himself in preperation for the career ahead.</p>

      <p>After college Donny struggled to get his foot in the door in Minnesota. He lived in a small town in Minnesota. Where most the job postings required many years experince which makes it very difficult to start out. Not long after this Donny came up with an idea to make a big move. After spending the next year or so saving and programming as a hobby he finally had enough to make that move. So Donny and his brother packed up everything they had in Minnesota and drove all there belongings to Austin Texas. Now that Donny has made it to Austin he is putting everything into starting his career in Web Development.</p>

      <p>After his first week in Austin he has made the first step towards his new career, this portfolio.</p>
